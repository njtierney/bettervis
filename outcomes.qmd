## Prerequisites

- Basic R programming experience
- No familiarity with ggplot2 required
- Experience working with data

## Learning outcomes

- How to think about creating good plots
- Good vs bad charts  
- Data-ink ratio  
- Clear message communication  
- Hierarchy of plot design (concepts of proximity)
- Fundamentals of ggplot2:
    - Understanding the grammar of graphics
    - Working with different geoms and aesthetics
    - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
    - Polishing plots for publication
    - Brief introduction to useful common extensions (e.g., patchwork)


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

1. Understand the grammar of graphics and how ggplot2 implements it
2. Map variables to aesthetics (x, y, colour, fill, shape, size) appropriately
3. Choose appropriate geometries for different data types (points, lines, bars, histograms)
4. Use faceting strategically to create small multiples with `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`
5. Apply the proximity principle when designing multi-variable plots
6. Recognise and create tidy data suitable for ggplot2
7. Reshape data using `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`
8. Create effective bar plots with proper sorting and positioning
9. Polish plots with labels, themes, colours, and legends
10. Handle overplotting using jitter, transparency, and summaries
11. Save publication-quality figures with `ggsave()`
